# Tridiagonal_Solver
Jupiter Notebooks for solving the tridiagonal system of equations on a quantum computer using Qiskit.

These are based on the Masters Thesis by Almudena Carerra Vasquez.

The idea is to perform Hamiltonian Simulation of a Tridiagonal System using the Trotter Method and then solve it using the HHL Algorithm.
